To further reduce the complexity of beam search and feedback over- head for large antenna systems, a codebook for full-complexity hybrid architecture can be designed to exploit the sparsity of mmWave channels. Each codeword is constructed based on the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm to minimize the MSE with the pre-defined ideal beam pattern.">

<node CREATED="1638026612898" ID="ID_959324773" MODIFIED="1638026614804" TEXT="The presence of RF transceiver imperfections degrades SE in various ways. For example, it is harder to accurately generate desired transmit signals when higher beamformer gain is aimed for; nonlinear distortion at the RX depends on the instantaneous channel gain and hence the SNR. Due to the transceiver imperfections being more pronounced at mmWaves, the SE and SNR of hybrid precoder/combiners no longer scale well with the number of RF chains. Figure 4 compares the SE of spatially sparse hybrid pre- coding, including RF imperfections, to that from fully digital beamforming based on SVD. The aggregate impact of the transceiver imperfections is modeled as a Gaussian process. The coarse- ly quantized phase shifters and the transceivers&#x2019; imperfections significantly degrade the SE. Knowl- edge of transceiver imperfections at mmWaves is essential for analyzing the scalability of the SE in the large MIMO regime.">

<node CREATED="1638029157446" ID="ID_418625983" MODIFIED="1638029159496" TEXT="Hybrid beamforming does not necessarily have inferior performance to fully digital beamform- ing. Analog beamforming can be implemented by means of phase shifters together with variable gain amplifiers. In this case, analog beamform- ing can provide the same functionality as digital beamforming, and combine desired multipath components (MPCs) (and suppress interfering MPCs) to the same degree as linear digital pro- cessing. Thus, in a narrowband massive MIMO system, with full-instantaneous CSI at the TX, this hybrid beamforming can achieve the same per- formance as fully digital beamforming if N S &#x2264; N RF [2]. A similar result can be obtained for a wide- band system, where the number of RF chains of the hybrid structure should be not smaller than min(N BS , N S,wb ) with N S,wb denoting the total number of data streaming over all subcarriers [7]. Since two phase-only entries for the analog precoder are equivalent to a single unconstrained (amplitude and phase) entry, fully digital perfor- mance can be achieved with phase-only hybrid BS structures if N RF &#x2265; 2N S in narrowband systems [2]">

<node CREATED="1638223064315" ID="ID_1960467746" MODIFIED="1638223066074" TEXT="Because of the complexity of Channel State Information (CSI) estimation and the overhead cost of its feedback, beam weight calculation from explicit CSI is very often prohibitive. Thus, codebook beamforming is often more appealing. Several codebook based beamforming methods were proposed in [7] [8] wherein the core concept is to go through the whole code book to find the best pair for transmission/reception. However such techniques are designed for indoor applications and considered only a relatively small numbers of antenna elements. As the number of antenna elements increases, the overhead of these protocols becomes prohibitively large and requires fine phase resolution (&#x3c0;/M, where M is the number of antenna elements) which is not practical. For this reason this paper considers only large antenna arrays with 1 or 2 bit phase resolution to offer the additional gain to meet the link budget requirements.">
